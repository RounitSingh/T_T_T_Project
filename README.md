## Problem Statement
Develop a frontend in Reactjs , which does the following:

1. Renders a "profile screen" as follows: https://www.terriblytinytales.com/profile.jpeg (this is a sample screenshot taken from mobile view)

2. The profile data can be hardcoded in a local JSON and need not have a backend.

3. The screen when opened on different mobile types, should render consistently. This can be checked in Chrome Inspect in mobile view, by changing device types or on actual physical devices.




## Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to run the project.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
5. Inspect the page and change the device type to view the responsiveness.

## Components

1. App.js - The main component which renders the All child components.

    Consists of 3 child components:
    1. Navbar
    2. Profile
    3. Posts

    Also consists 2 elements:
    1. Cover Image
    2. Posts Container UI


2. Navbar.jsx - The component which renders the Navbar.
